# Disclaimer

* This project is **not** intended for use in real projects
* This project is a diploma project for my university degree, and does **not** replace any of the existing **mature**
  tools such as **[nomad](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/)**
  and **[KubeOne](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone)**. If you need to scale your application, use them instead.
* This project can be an example for learning Rust, some system design, etc. With this project I'm trying to practice
  things like cross-server communication, config parsing, version history, synchronization algorithms, writing plugins (
  possibly), writing a requests for hosting providers, some DevOps and automated deploy experience etc.

**So, if you find this repo and your interests are similar to mine, you should read this disclaimer and use this app for
educational purposes only.**
Look at the code, read it, copy it, launch it, do anything you want.
